FOUNDERS IMAGE PLACEHOLDER
==========================

To add your founders image (Rohan & Tarun's photo), please follow these steps:

1. Prepare your image:
   - Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels or larger
   - Recommended format: PNG or JPG
   - Image should show both founders clearly

2. Rename your image to one of these names:
   - founders.png (recommended)
   - founders.jpg
   - founders.jpeg
   - about_us.png
   - about_us.jpg

3. Place the image in this folder:
   app/src/main/assets/

4. The app will automatically detect and display your image!

If no image is found, the app will show a placeholder with initials "R" and "T" and the text "Rohan & Tarun - Founders, Campus Network"
